        <h3>Our Mission</h3>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Horizon is an innovative company focused on the needs of the basic consumer. Our mission is get customers their purchases as quickly and efficiently as possible. Using our new technology from our collaboration with SpaceX, we are able to launch packages in our Drop Pods&reg; from our new Overlord Satellites&reg;. We have decreased the time it takes for customers to get their packages, with only a few technical difficulties that have since been brought to our attention. We are working on adjusting the landing gear and protocol to assure that no more issues occur.

        <h3>Our Origin Story</h3>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The origin of our company is inspiring and motivational. Only few people get the opportunity that we did to bring our amazing service to the everyday consumer. We make sure to have moments of appreciation for the start of our wonderful company. We had a very humble beginning, thanks to the social media platform, Twitter. Our CEO, Nole Ksum, tweeted his idea at Elon Musk on April 20<sup>th</sup>, 2020, saying,
            <blockquote>
                <p><strong id='papaelon'>@elonmusk</strong> what if you delivered packages to people from space, like amazon but from space</p>
            </blockquote>
        The tweet got 200,000 retweets, and the next day, Nole Ksum was made the CEO of our company, Horizon&copy;. Elon Musk's SpaceX decided to collaborate with our company to create our Drop Pods&reg; and Overlord Satellites&reg;. We have since been continuing to perfect our system to help customers get their packages as soon as possible, and we are working on making our Drop Pods's&reg; landing protocol less damaging to make our customers even happier.
